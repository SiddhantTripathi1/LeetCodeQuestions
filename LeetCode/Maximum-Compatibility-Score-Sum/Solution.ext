Input: students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]], mentors = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 8
Explanation:Â We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.
